## About

- Once you've given it a name, a description and a location to save the file, the subject will automatically create a new topic within that subject.
- Click on the `edit` button at the bottom of the topic view (or press `e`) to start editiing your content. All text fields can now be changed.
- Click on the `+` and `-` buttons in the panel on the left to add new pages or concepts (groupings of pages).
- Click on `present` (or press `ESC`) to go back to presenting mode
- Double-click anywhere and start typing to add a new note.
- Click on `draw` and drag your mouse cursor to start drawing (*experimental*)
- Click `save` to save the session.
- Click `exit` to exit back to the main board.
