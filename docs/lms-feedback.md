- courses (essential)
- calendar (superfluous)
- inbox (superfluous)

- - inside courses
- - - discussions and announcements are superfluous BUT assignments might be worth looking into

the idea of the syllabus implies another layer of export: including dates and assignments (readings, homework, deadlines). ASSIGNMENTS CAN JUST BE PUT AS THE LAST SLIDE

when you're inside the course, it gets a bit of information overload but not that much

when you create a syllabus in MM, there should be a feature to upload a syllabus, i think.

There is a **resources** section, with e.g. copyright directives, technology services, which could be useful

- discussions aren't really relevant for the small scale classes i'm dealing with

- gradebook? maybe not

MULTIMODAL EXPORTS ARE TEXTBOOKS FOR THREE YEARS LATER

The **pages** section is interesting, they are standalone documents (like a wiki!)

The **outcomes** section is also interesting cause it deals with learning assessment, which isn't always a given. How about adding learning outcomes to the syllabus creation? And then track those outcomes across classes/concepts/etc.?

The **file upload** is also interesting/necessary. it prevents from having to link from outside

how different is it? essentially the same, if not less features. the interface might seem a little nicer but really not that much...

**MULTIMODAL IS NOT A LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**. it's a learning experience system, it allows you to focus on class as *immediate present* and *distant future*
