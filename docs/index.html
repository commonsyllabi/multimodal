<h2>Multimodal is a desktop app for teaching</h2>

  Multimodal is a desktop application for teachers and students alike, harnessing the capabilities of the web browser to go beyond a simple slide-to-slide-to-slide delivery.

<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>
  Knowledge delivery in the classroom includes more and more multimedia content and less and less linear description of a particular topic to a passive audience. Multimodal came from the frusration of the staticness of every slideshow solution offered -once you write it, you're not meant to change it on the fly, and you're supposed to follow a pre-defined order.<br />
  <br />
  Because the tools we use have an impact on how we think, Multimodal offers the possibility of being as flexible as possible while providing a holistic and self-contained experience, so that you don't have to switch between a browser, a code editor, a slide show presenter and a text editor in order to provide the people in the room with a learning experience appropriate for all types of learners, and not just those that are good that reading sequantial chunks of text.<br />
  <br />
  On a more theoretical level, Multimodal was inspired by the thoughts of:

  The point of Multimodal is to take advantadge of the possibilities brought by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">HTML5</a>, while at the same time living in the offline environment, and therefore offering and more focused and reliable experience than a simple web app. This is why Multimodal is first and foremost built on <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>. Multimodal includes:

<p>
  Multimodal defines a certain vocabulary. At the core is a <b>lesson</b>, which is what can be displayed and manipulated during the teaching time. Lessons are composed of <b>concepts</b>, which basically represent a page of each lesson. Each lesson starts with <b>prep-notes</b> (e.g. text, images, videos, websites), written down beforehand by the teacher, and gets <b>in-class notes</b> added during the teaching. Lessons are contained into <b>courses</b>, which then get exported as HTML files (think of your course as a whole website with a separate page for each lesson).
  <ul>
  <li>
    <b>Downlading Multimodal</b> (currently supported are OSX and Linux) here and installing it.

  </ul>
