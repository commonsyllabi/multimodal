<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>
  Knowledge delivery in the classroom includes more and more multimedia content and less and less static communication of a particular topic to a passive audience. <b>Multimodal came from the frustration with the rigidity of current popular slideware</b>, and with the need to jump between multiple different windows and applications during lectures.<br />
  <br />
<b>Multimodal strives to be as flexible as possible, while still remaining a holistic and self-contained experience</b>, so that you don't have to switch between a browser, a text editor, a slide show presenter and a image processor in order to provide the people in the room with a satsifying learning experience. By mixing-in writing, drawing and web-browsing materials, it aims at being appropriate for all types of learners, and not just those that are good at reading sequences of bullet points.<br />
  <br />
  The result is <b>a hybrid between a slideshow, a whiteboard and a web browser</b>, with which you can create and organize <b>your research, your classes and your textbook</b>. Live, Multimodal includes the ability to change any aspect of the lecture on the fly and to export your lesson to web and print with appropriate custom layouts for each.<br />
  <br />
  On a more theoretical level, Multimodal was inspired by the thoughts of:

  The point of Multimodal is to take advantage of the possibilities brought by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">HTML5</a>, while at the same time living in the offline environment, and therefore offering a more focused and reliable experience than a simple web app. This is why Multimodal is first and foremost built on <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>. Multimodal includes:

  Multimodal defines a certain vocabulary. At the core is a <b>lesson</b>, which is what can be displayed and manipulated during the teaching time. Lessons are composed of <b>concepts</b>, which represent a page of each lesson. Each lesson starts with <b>prep-notes</b> (e.g. text, images, videos, websites), written down beforehand by the teacher, and <b>in-class notes</b> added during the teaching. Lessons are contained in <b>courses</b>, which then get exported as HTML files (think of your course as a whole website with a separate page for each lesson).
  <ul>
  <li>
    <b>Downlading Multimodal</b> (currently supported are OSX and Linux) <a href="https://github.com/periode/multimodal/releases">here</a> and installing it.

  </ul>
  <h3>Before a lesson</h3>
=======
  Multimodal defines a certain vocabulary. At the core is a <b class="important">subject</b>, which is equivalent to a whole course, described by a syllabus. Within that <b class="important">subject</b> are different <b class="important">topics</b>, which are equivalent to class sessions. Different groups of students will share the same <b class="important">subject</b> but will go through each <b class="important">topics</b> at a different pace.<br/>
  <br/>
  A specific <b class="important">topics</b> has multiple components, which help you compose a thorough resource for the students. Each <b class="important">topics</b> is divided into <b class="important">concepts</b>, broad ideas which take several <b class="important">pages</b> to develop. Each <b class="important">concept</b> has a <b class="important">context</b> where the teacher can add links and notes relevant to this particular concept.<br/>
  <br/>
  <b class="important">Pages</b> are the smallest unit, and what you interact with during class times. Each <b class="important">page</b> includes <b class="important">preps</b>, text, images, videos or links which act as leads for the trajectory of the class, <b class="important">writeup</b>, which are more thorough explanation of the topic that is being discussed, and <b class="important">notes</b>, texts and drawings that are added to the page as the class discussion unfolds.<br/>
  <br />
  Each <b class="important">subject</b> can then be exported either as a website or as a PDF document, adapting its contents and layouts to each medium.
