- ability to access online?
- how about webrecording links, and then choosing to have access to the live link or archived link

- class sessions is an interesting perspective
- canonical classes vs. recitations

- being able to add learning outcomes/tags for each structure (topic? concepts?)

- make sure it is searchable

- how is it beneficial to the students? how does one find that out?
