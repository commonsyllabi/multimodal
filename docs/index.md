title: MultiModal makes tools built for the way we research, write, discuss and share today. 
description: Our goal is to promote a workflow centric approach to the design of authoring tools that prioritizes non-linear authoring workflows and interoperability.

## Why Create New Tools? 
As researchers and educators ourselves, our motivation came out of the frustration with the rigidity and assumptions of existing slideware (google slides, keynote, powerpoint, etc.), and with the need to switch frequently between multiple windows and applications when preparing and presenting materials. 
  
As it turns out, leading office tools today still implicitly carry the outdated assumptions on which early day office publishing software was based on (flat hierarchy, strict separation between presenter and audience, isolated exports). Trying to shoehorn the often iterative creative research process into the office tools paradigm, results unsurprisingly in inefficiencies and scattered materials. 
  
With the MultiModal project, our goal is to design for real-world practices around research, collaboration and pedagogy. We want to create a digital ecosystem that is as conducive for creative writing and thinking, as it is for discussion and presentation. We believe that flexibility when it comes to modes of engaging with the material can minimize or altogether eliminate administrative overhead, allowing attention to focus primarily on creating and sharing knowledge.
