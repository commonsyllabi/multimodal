## Building Tools for Our Needs

As educators ourselves, our motivation came out of disappointment with thae existing tools at our disposal.

### Our frustration stems from:

1. **not having access to our colleagues’ syllabi.**
2. **not having tools that support the process of authoring and maintaining syllabi **
3. **having to utilize presentation software that fall short for educational purposes**

## Knowledge Siloing

### **Hindered access to our colleagues’ syllabi.**

Counterintuitively, given today’s technology, there still exists no platform on which educators can publish and browse the syllabi they have created for their classes. Virtually ever Learning Management Systems (LMS) deployed by leading education institutions do not allow for the open sharing of syllabi content. This is especially ironic given that academia is, by and large, a field that prizes open sharing and collaborative progress.

If teachers wish to share syllabi they have authored outside of the confines of institutional LMS, they may theoretically do so independently. Some educators resort to self-publishing their syllabi, often on one-off microsites. However, these sites, being highly decentralized, unstandardized and often tedious to maintain, are difficult to index meaningfully. For the systematic browsing of syllabi, an open standard for the formatting of curricula is necessary. Unfortunately, while an open standard exists for formatting curricula, the adoption of this standard is so poor that most educators have never heard of the Common Cartridge (CC) format.

### **BORROWED, RATHER THAN BESPOKE, TOOLS**

#### .docx vs. Synthesis

##### **A need for tools that support the creative process of creating syllabi.**

Any educator would know that syllabi may, and often do, evolve over time. Many a time, there arises the need to abridge or expand upon material, depending on a course’s format, delivery or audience. The work of authoring and maintaining syllabi is hardly linear; it is often a lateral and iterative creative process. Educators are left to hop between several tools to support different aspects of their workflow.

#### .pptx vs. Improv

##### **Having to utilize presentation software that fall short in pedagogical settings**

Furthermore, there is often much improvisation and tailoring during the delivery of the course material itself. For example, in the course of a class, notes are being taken, diagrams drawn, websites visited, etc. This creates a problem because the word processors and slideware that educators use were hardly designed for such styles of conversational presentation, let alone bundling of such distributed and dynamic content.

## Building It _for_ Educators, and by Educators

We work on this project because we believe that there can, and should, be tools that better suit the specific needs of educators. It is a big project, but when broken down into smaller components, we believe the mission is possible.

## The Challenges

###### CHALLENGE 1:

### Enable Access: There is no public repository of syllabi

Currently, the curricula designed by educators are too often locked away behind the walls of proprietary software and institutional accounts. Despite the fact that educators typically own the IP rights to the course material they develop, there are few tools that specifically support the open sharing of syllabi between teachers.

In the spirit of the open science movement, the free circulation of academic materials benefits all, this is true of research materials, as well as for pedagogical materials.

<div class="two-up-table">
    <div class="table-cell">
        <h6>CHALLENGE 1A:</h6>
        <h3>Support Portability</h3>
        <p>A common format lays key groundwork for open exchange.</p>
        <p>Delaying the adoption of such format(s) also jeopardizes the longevity of knowledge by hindering the viability of creating openly accessible repositories and/or archives.  </p>
        <h6>PROJECT:</h6>
        <h3>Common Cartridge Viewer Web App</h3>
        <p>
        The Common Cartridge (CC)Viewer Web App is an open source tool for viewing course materials in the CC format.   
        </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="table-cell">
        <h6>CHALLENGE 1B:</h6>
        <h3>Supporting Open Publication & Exchange </h3>
        <p>
        Siloed resources hinder educators from having a macro-level visibility of their peers’ work across fields. Since many educators resort to publishing course materials on personal websites, discovering and consulting curricula developed by peers is an arduous task of navigating scattered, un-indexed resources.
        </p>
        <p>
        The syllabi listings project aims to make syllabi accessible and meaningfully searchable.
        </p>
        <h6>PROJECT</h6>
        <h3>Syllabi Listings <sup>[Beta]</sup></h3>
        <p>
        On Syllabi Listings, teachers can browse what their colleagues are teaching across the world, as well as publicly share their own syllabi.
        </p>
        <p>
        Syllabi Listings will support Common Cartridge imports, as well as the upload of regular documents (docx, pdf) and links.
        </p>

###### CHALLENGE 2:

### Usability: Educators are required to use multiple softwares are used in the classroom

The everyday tools used by educators today are often not built with real-world classroom and pedagogical planning needs in mind. With the MultiModal project, our goal is to design for real-world practices around research, collaboration and pedagogy.

<div class="two-up-table">
    <div class="table-cell">
        <h6>CHALLENGE 2A:</h6>
        <h3>Supporting syllabi synthesis</h3>
        <p>
        Leading office tools today still implicitly carry the outdated assumptions on which early day office publishing software was based on (flat hierarchy, strict separation between presenter and audience, isolated exports).
        </p>
        <h6>PROJECT</h6>
        <h3>MultiModal Writer</h3>
        <p>
        Our goal is to create a tool that supports the non-linear creative workflow of syllabi planning and publishing. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The tool will also include features such as managing syllabi across sections of students, and evolving course content over semesters.
        </p>
        <p>
        Eventually, collaborative authoring will also be supported.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="table-cell">
        <h6>CHALLENGE 2B:</h6>
        <h3>Supporting classroom teaching</h3>
        <p>Our tools should be able to reflect such an environment, and support the spontaneity of classroom interactions without acting as a normative infrastructure.
        </p>
        <h6>PROJECT</h6>
        <h3>MultiModal Classroom</h3>
        <p>
        Classrooms are places of dynamic exchanges and conversation between students and instructors.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a result, existing slideware (google slides, keynote, powerpoint, etc.), forces us to switch frequently between multiple windows and applications when preparing and presenting materials.
        </p>
        <p>
        MM Front addresses those issues by merging the ease of use of traditional presentation software with context building features such as drawing, note-taking, structured document organization and hyperlinking.
