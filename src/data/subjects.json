science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

going to be about understanding what goes on behind the scenes. what is \"the cloud\"? what is \"artificial intelligence\"? what is \"user experience\"? what is \"a platform\"? these are all different metaphors that we have started to use in order to refer to layers, or stacks, of technologies that end up being presented and communicated to the broader audience in a simplified manner.\nit is about understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge in the 21st century, specifically around the issues of living in a digital world.\n\n"}},{"name":"two questions","notes":[{"saved":true,"tag":"","text":"relying on machines (hard

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class

science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class

Software started as being by default open-source, since it was shared and distributed amongst a close networks of academics and researchers. It's only when it became expensive to write software (relatively to the cost of hardware) that it made economic sense to make software a kind of intellectual property, particularly under the influence of early companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Apple whose business model depended on exclusive rights to use and distribute software. Bill Gates particularly stood up against the common practices at the time which consisted in sharing source code in order to share software. By the end of the 70s, the copyright rules had caught up and proprietary software was the norm.\n\nIn response to that, a group of academics started the GNU project, which consisted in providing open-source software which could also be re-used in whatever way the user saw fit.\n\nWe will talk more about the implications of open-source in economic terms; the important point for now is that there is a pervasive belief within hackers, and within those who associate with the hacker movement, that more information is always better, that access to knowledge should be unlimited and unregulated, and that one should be judged a posteriori, by its results, rather than a priori."}},{"name":"information wants to be free","notes":[{"saved":true,"tag":"","text":"user","type":"text","x":"750","y":"-4086"}],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"from bulletin board systems to the web 2.0","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"These social practices of hacker culture and the associated ethos of closed-source/open-source, proprietary/free software, are closely intertwined with the the means of communication, whether how they created these cultures, and how these cultures created them.\n\nOne the one side, you have things like the early communication systems: SSH, BBS, Usenet, IRC, etc. These were designed to allow for interaction between the participants (except for SSH, which allowed multiple people to use the same machine at the same time), and followed the design of a public message board, or a public chat. It took the web sometime to integrate these models of communication to its architecture (the web was originally made to serve static, non-interactable content). The switch towards a more user-friendly web (one with comments, wikis, blog posts, etc.) has led to what is called the __Web 2.0__.\n\nOn the other side, the hacker ethos transpired into some of the largest commercial digital products of our times. Products like MySpace, Facebook, AirBnB or Uber stand in the direct tradition of \"hacking\", and most companies and institutions now organize \"hackathons\", associating the practice with a sort of brainstorming.

The switch to the Web 2.0 is then a switch in scale and usability. It becomes easier to edit things live, to set-up complex systems like a blog or a personal page, and to interact with webpages in ways that were either new or previously restricted to non-web systems (e.g. google maps, google drive, etc.). The Web 2.0 became emblematic by the platforms that appeared: MySpace, Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook et. al.). Anyone can now theoretically say anything to anyone else. Information is free.\n\nOne of the first manifestations of these new possibilities is the creation of cultural groups online. With the streamlining of information sharing, and the reduction of friction in user interfaces and user experiences, sub-cultures started to develop (around Second Life, MySpace, Tumblr, etc.), around shared tastes, interests and activities. Exclusively-online cultures, such as MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon), which have been around as early as the 80s are now a possibility, and individuals are no longer restricted by lack of access or geographic remoteness.\n\nThis abundance of access has another consequence. It is no longer necessary to ask permission from traditional content-producers (e.g. newspapers) in order to publish and discuss something. Social media (like IndyMedia, Ohmynews, Rue89) were set-up in order to bypass the censorship and barrier to entry in existing dominant media. The result of this lack of moderation isn't always the magical appearance of high-quality content, but rather a complicated intertwining of broad tendencies, existing cultural agendas and economic incentives."}},{"name":"social media","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"the massification of the participative web is social media","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"we moved away from social networks for producers towards social networks for consumers","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"Once all of these technologies are in place, we get what we call \"social media\".

For example, Facebook and Google are two platforms that have enforced real name policies, and multiple others allow users to be \"verified\", by establishing a proof of who they are offline, and online.\n\nA social network is therefore a platform in which every user has a personal page, and can interact with other users' personal pages.

The founder of the Free Software movement, Richard Stallman, was known online by his acronym (RMS) than by his full name.\n\nHackers and commercial producers then developed a first version of tools which were used for more and more FICTIONAL BEING, along with FICTIONAL DOING. These included blogs, wikis, personal pages and profiles, as well as online game-worlds.\n\nFinally, with the advent of commercial, holistic social media, the tendency pushes even further towards REAL BEING. This doesn't mean that we are all exposed fully all the time, but rather that we acknoweldge that it is no longer the point to project completely fictional personas.

While anyone can theoretically contribute to the kernel (the core of the Linux ecosystem), it is up to the creator, Linus Torvalds, to ultimately approve or deny the final integration of the contribution in the kernel. Both of these forms of organization are based around the idea of contribution: it is what you add to the commons that is the only criteria for judgment.\n\nAnother form of political organization is the one that integrates with existing structures (e.g. local or state governments). The improved means of communication through digital channels allow us to re-imagine the idea of direct democracy. Each one can theoretically directly contribute to the public debate.\n\nAs J.R. Licklider put it: “The political process would essentially be a giant teleconference, and a campaign would be a months-long series of communications among candidates, propagandists, commentators, political action groups, and voters.

With the modernization of communication infrastructure, and before the internet, it became possible to consult the people for exceptional cases at a large scale (referendums) or ordinary cases at a small scale. These interventions of participative democracy were still one-offs, since it wasn't sustainable to continuously maintain them.\n\nFinally came the model of liquid democracy: if we can all participate to everything all the time, it is not realistic to assume that all citizens will have equal expertise on topics. Liquid democracy is a model which assumes that each citizen has a voting \"token\" and can delegate that token to someone whom they trust on a particular issue, thus connecting the online-based model of expertise of individuals with the more traditional idea of voting structures."}},{"name":"the online public sphere","notes":[{"saved":true,"tag":"","text":"cou","type":"text","x":"750","y":"-349"}],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"from habermas...","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"... to twitter","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"Any of these forms of democracies rely on an idea called the \"public sphere\". The public sphere is a concept developed by Jurgen Habermas in 1962 in which he highlights the distinction between the state and the public arenas of citizen discourse. Politics do not exclusively happen through the state: they happen through semi-formal and informal, speech-based, exchanges between informed citizens (private persons discussing public concerns). The public sphere is to debating and argumenting what the market is to buying and selling. However, while an essential component of democratic life, the public sphere as originally described had some issues: class and gender distinctions, state manipulation due to state welfare (public funding of various institutions, from media to entertainment to unemployment) and the illusion that the bourgeois, liberal public sphere is the only public sphere (disregarding anything dissenting discourse as a valid political discourse).\n\nHow does the digital public sphere change that? As we've seen there was a shift between the roles of fictional and real personas online. While fictional personas online used to be understood as tokens of anonymity, and therefore the means to judge someone exclusively on __what__ they had to say, real personas online have brought back the ideas of class and gender distinctions.\n\nWhile the existence of multiple, dissenting discourse can be seen as a proactive force for democracy, the illusion of one single \"sphere\" has underestimated the presence of filter bubbles, and qualified them in negative terms instead of working around them to make them communicate.

It then allowed for precise coordination during specific protest movements (e.g. using Blackberry Messenger in Hong-Kong, Twitter in Egypt and Iran).\n\nHowever, it stopped being useful for two reasons: because of the lack of unity required for long-term political organization, and because other political forces entered the online sphere, both directly (creating accounts on these platforms and influencing the objects of discourses on them) and indirectly (understanding the processes through which information is shared, and to whom, in order to act pre-emptively through targeted censorship)."}},{"name":"government response","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"censorship has moved from blanket prohibition...","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"... to upstream control of commercial platforms, ...","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"... to customized targeting of dissidents,...","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"... and pro-active disinformation (from Obama to Putin)","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"If governmental response did take some time to develop, it was mostly because they didn't quite understand the means through which censorship could work in this new ecosystem.

science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

going to be about understanding what goes on behind the scenes. what is \"the cloud\"? what is \"artificial intelligence\"? what is \"user experience\"? what is \"a platform\"? these are all different metaphors that we have started to use in order to refer to layers, or stacks, of technologies that end up being presented and communicated to the broader audience in a simplified manner.\nit is about understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge in the 21st century, specifically around the issues of living in a digital world.\n\n"}},{"name":"two questions","notes":[{"saved":true,"tag":"","text":"relying on machines (hard

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class

It does so by structuring the data in a very particular way (see resources for a detailed explanation).\n\nThose two protocols were designed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn at UCLA in 1967, and the first packet sent according to these protocols was sent on October 29, 1969.

science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class

Or into tools in general? Because tools are a way to do things (Weizenbaum), and there is never just one correct way of doing something, particularly when it comes to learning types. It's then a matter of realizing that tools afford ways to do things, and it makes it harder to do things differently. Put it like this, tools aren't that different from rules and regulations. Again, rules and regulations aren't a bad thing. The rule \"You should not kill\" is a pretty good one which has helped humans get along quite decently. Rules and regulations, just like tools, become harmful whenever they are not closely examined, taken for granted or, worse, as part of the natural order of things."}},{"name":"starting from values","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"value-sensitive design (VSD) is a software development paradigm which aims at putting a set of values as the starting point of any design work.","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"Value-Sensitive Design is a process of putting values first in the development process.

There is a lot of writing about the interactivity of software, and it seems that what was \"interactive\" 5 years ago is now \"smart\" now. It might be a buzzword, but interactivity is essential to any human activity. Game Design Chris Crawford states that the most interactive system is that of a human discussion. The fact that it is both simple (children can do it) and complex (we still don't know exactly how it works) is astounding, and our tools should aim at supporting this exchange, in any way possible. Indeed, when discussions happens between a small group of people, it's easy to keep track, but when a larger group (e.g. a class) is involved, then being able to write down the main points of the discussion helps maintain the focus of the discussion.\n\nOne possible way is PowerPoint, which augments the speech of the presenter. But how about augmenting the speech of the presented? This is precisely what maieutics is, the development of the Socratic method, in which questions are asked to the presented in order to birth knowledge through them, and for them, rather than slamming it onto their ears and eyes.\n\nThe first value is therefore that of interactivity between people.\n\n"}},{"name":"contextuality","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"being aware of when, where and why something exists","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"being relevant before class, during class, and after class","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"being aware of the relationship between a course and a class","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"Class is a particular moment in the learning process, but is in no way the only moment that students or teachers engage with the learning material.

The story goes that, when movie cameras started to become popular, we did what we knew how to do so far: we put it on a tripod in front of a theater stage, and let it roll for the whole performance.\n\nI would argue that this is the same thing with slideware: we used to make printed slides, and we still reason in terms of print media, with marginal improvements including animations, videos and hyperlinks.\n\nLev Manovich, in his book The Language of New Media, details what makes new media \"new\". I've extracted some of those properties here (excluding numerical representation, and automation).\n\n- Modularity is the ability to break something into smaller components, and re-assemble these components differently. For example, a single page can be extracted and edited without having to change and re-print the whole structure.\n- Variability is the ability to have a component change given a certain set of circumstances. For instance, a topic can be given new values and affect the whole structure without having to rebuild that whole structure (think light mode vs. dark mode)\n- Transcoding is the ability to represent the same thing in different ways.

The point is for the teacher to see what the students will see, which implies that students could also see presenter notes during the class itself, if these are relevant. While hiding presenter notes from a presentation in classical slideware might come from the need to maintain both a rigid discourse (again, more presentation than exchange), and to prevent a clutter of information, it is possible to think of the teacher/student relationship as a non-hierarchical one: whatever the teacher sees, the student should also be able to see it, and such a relationship could be based on mutual respect of the ways of doing rather than on the withholding of information creating an imbalance of power."}},{"name":"context","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"a textbook, a slideshow, a whiteboard and a website can co-exist","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"If text is text, if the language of new media teaches us that data can adapt to different circumstances, and if a class is just a different manifestation of a syllabus, and if class notes are a different manifestation of a class, shouldn't it be possible to write __something__ which encapsulates all three modes of being of knowledge (research, class and notes) and presents itself in different ways based on which moment it is currently being used?\n\nIn that sense, context is just the circumstances underwhich a certain ecosystem deploys some of its aspects, and removes other aspects, in order to focus on the matter at hand."}},{"name":"interfaces","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"deciding what to show, and when to show it","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"The corollary to that is understanding the role of interfaces.
