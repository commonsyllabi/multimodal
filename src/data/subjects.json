science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

going to be about understanding what goes on behind the scenes. what is \"the cloud\"? what is \"artificial intelligence\"? what is \"user experience\"? what is \"a platform\"? these are all different metaphors that we have started to use in order to refer to layers, or stacks, of technologies that end up being presented and communicated to the broader audience in a simplified manner.\nit is about understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge in the 21st century, specifically around the issues of living in a digital world.\n\n"}},{"name":"two questions","notes":[{"saved":true,"tag":"","text":"relying on machines (hard

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class

science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class

science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

going to be about understanding what goes on behind the scenes. what is \"the cloud\"? what is \"artificial intelligence\"? what is \"user experience\"? what is \"a platform\"? these are all different metaphors that we have started to use in order to refer to layers, or stacks, of technologies that end up being presented and communicated to the broader audience in a simplified manner.\nit is about understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge in the 21st century, specifically around the issues of living in a digital world.\n\n"}},{"name":"two questions","notes":[{"saved":true,"tag":"","text":"relying on machines (hard

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class

science, or to software engineering. the digital is the interweaving of technical apparatuses, such as code, with the complexity of social, economical, and cultural influences. the digital becomes culture when it becomes enters into a dialogue with human choices and preferences\n\nas the science-fiction writer philip k. dick put it very elegantly, \"science-fiction is not about inventing cars, it's about inventing traffic jams\". the digital is not just about numbers, then, but about how we use numbers in our society today, and how those numbers affect human behaviour.\n\nalan m. turing wrote a seminal paper in the early 1950s, in which he proved that \"all that could be calculated could be calculated with a particular machine\". that machine he goes on to describe is known as a Turing machine, and computers are particular versions of turing machines. the main question is then to define \"what are the limits of that which we can represent with numbers, and then compute it?\". it turns out, quite a lot. we can represent images, sounds, weather, physical objects, single individuals and groups of people as numbers. each of these can then become the subject of computation."}},{"name":"three

understanding what are all the different dynamics, actors and agendas at play during the creation of technologies, and of services based on these technologies. through this understanding, it becomes easier to see how these technologies affect societies, and how societies can affect these technologies in return (e.g. the NSA has a very keen understanding of internet technologies in order to have a very efficient monitoring program, or the GDPR in the E.U. has been deployed as a response to data breaches that no privacy policy had ever had to take into account before)\n\ncoding is going to be the practical component. while code isn't the only thing that makes up \"the digital\", it is a strange enough artefact that we think it's necessary for you to get a glimpse of what it entails to write code, how easy or how unfamiliar it can be.\nbeyond this introduction, it is also a way to familiarize yourselves with the specifics of new forms of publishing on the web, in order to understand and use in a relevant way what makes the web such a unique space for creating and distributing knowledge (multimedia, hyperlinks, dynamic content, data processing, etc.)\n\nfinally, the investigation is going to allow you to design and implement a sociological inquiry built both on the theoretical foundations of decoding digital culture, and on the the practical foundations of coding digital content. we'll talk more about the specifics of that inquiry later on, but this is essentially the part of the class were you show that you've understood what it means to create and publish knowledge

that information-processing technologies are all essentially extensions of man (mcluhan). they influence the things we can do as humans, and particularly what we can remember. they allow us to externalize knowledge, codify it and therefore transmit it better. because in a post-enlightenment civilization externalized knowledge is the grounds upon which we build the truths of the world we live in.\n\nthe second one is that technology, and particularly the practical manifestation of technology known as tools are already in themselves the embodiment of a know-how (weizenbaum). a hammer is a physical embodiment of the act of hitting something into something else. a keyboard is the physical embodiment of an alphabetical script. a certain type of programming language is going to be the (somewhat) physical embodiment of a certain representation of the world.\n\nthe last one, which is particular relevant to digital technologies, is the use of psychological techniques in order to trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no

Or into tools in general? Because tools are a way to do things (Weizenbaum), and there is never just one correct way of doing something, particularly when it comes to learning types. It's then a matter of realizing that tools afford ways to do things, and it makes it harder to do things differently. Put it like this, tools aren't that different from rules and regulations. Again, rules and regulations aren't a bad thing. The rule \"You should not kill\" is a pretty good one which has helped humans get along quite decently.

It might be a buzzword, but interactivity is essential to any human activity. Game Design Chris Crawford states that the most interactive system is that of a human discussion. The fact that it is both simple (children can do it) and complex (we still don't know exactly how it works) is astounding, and our tools should aim at supporting this exchange, in any way possible. Indeed, when discussions happens between a small group of people, it's easy to keep track, but when a larger group (e.g. a class) is involved, then being able to write down the main points of the discussion helps maintain the focus of the discussion.\n\nOne possible way is PowerPoint, which augments the speech of the presenter. But how about augmenting the speech of the presented? This is precisely what maieutics is, the development of the Socratic method, in which questions are asked to the presented in order to birth knowledge through them, and for them, rather than slamming it onto their ears and eyes.\n\nThe first value is therefore that of interactivity between people.\n\n"}},{"name":"contextuality","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"being aware of when, where and why something exists","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"being relevant before class, during class, and after class","type":"txt"},{"tag":"","text":"being aware of the relationship between a course and a class","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"Class is a particular moment in the learning process, but is in no way the only moment that students or teachers engage with the learning material.

I've extracted some of those properties here (excluding numerical representation, and automation).\n\n- Modularity is the ability to break something into smaller components, and re-assemble these components differently. For example, a single page can be extracted and edited without having to change and re-print the whole structure.\n- Variability is the ability to have a component change given a certain set of circumstances. For instance, a topic can be given new values and affect the whole structure without having to rebuild that whole structure (think light mode vs. dark mode)\n- Transcoding is the ability to represent the same thing in different ways.

The point is for the teacher to see what the students will see, which implies that students could also see presenter notes during the class itself, if these are relevant. While hiding presenter notes from a presentation in classical slideware might come from the need to maintain both a rigid discourse (again, more presentation than exchange), and to prevent a clutter of information, it is possible to think of the teacher/student relationship as a non-hierarchical one: whatever the teacher sees, the student should also be able to see it, and such a relationship could be based on mutual respect of the ways of doing rather than on the withholding of information creating an imbalance of power."}},{"name":"context","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"a textbook, a slideshow, a whiteboard and a website can co-exist","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"If text is text, if the language of new media teaches us that data can adapt to different circumstances, and if a class is just a different manifestation of a syllabus, and if class notes are a different manifestation of a class, shouldn't it be possible to write __something__ which encapsulates all three modes of being of knowledge (research, class and notes) and presents itself in different ways based on which moment it is currently being used?\n\nIn that sense, context is just the circumstances underwhich a certain ecosystem deploys some of its aspects, and removes other aspects, in order to focus on the matter at hand."}},{"name":"interfaces","notes":[],"preps":[{"tag":"","text":"deciding what to show, and when to show it","type":"txt"}],"tag":"","writeup":{"text":"The corollary to that is understanding the role of interfaces.
