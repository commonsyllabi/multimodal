regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no

trigger dopamine releases in the brains of the consumers (pretty icons, satisfying interactions, endless distribution of addictive content).\n\non the opposite, the way that we shape digital systems is both concrete and elusive.\n\nconcretely, the market economy dictates design and development decisions based on what makes the consumer consume the most. the government bodies issues rules and regulations allowing or banning certain features (google in china, or uber in berlin, for a little bit) and the military funds fundamental research in areas relevant to them.\n\nin a more diffuse way, we shape digital systems through the complex interactions that happen in human societies, and through the myths, practices and manners of doing that we project onto new systems. urban planning regulations can reflect racial biases in a given society (robert moses). the male gaze as a patriarchal social practice was reflected in the design of facebook (kate losse). the political scandals of surveillance lead to new government regulations (again, the GDPR). the need for military reconnaissance leads to the development of computer vision rather than computer speech.\n\nthere is no clear-cut boundary between these two dynamics, and understanding digital culture means understanding how and when each of them are at play."}},{"name":"class
